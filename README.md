# Cloud_Projects
This repository will be used to track my progress in my cloud security journey as I get to do various hands-on projects on cloud service providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Azure.

#### Some of my AWS projects include using the following services:
 * Identity and Access Management (IAM) - creating entities (roles, groups, users) and adding an extra layer of security (MFA)
 * Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) - launching instances, creating AMI of instances, and connecting to instances via SSH (with mobaxterm and ssh client) and instance connect
 * Simple Storage Service (S3) -storing objects (such as source code) in buckets, while giving the appropriate permission
 * Auto-scaling Group (ASG) - attaching auto-scaling group to elastic beanstalk, for automatic scaling 
 * Basics of Infrastructure as Code - Terraform - creating cloud resources using hashicorp configuration language (HCL)
 * Elastic load balancer (ELB)- for equal distribution of traffic among ec2 instances, among others
